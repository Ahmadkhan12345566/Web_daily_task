        The armitage component of Metasploit is a fully interactive graphical user interface created by Raphael Mudge. This interface is highly impressive, feature rich, and available for free. We won’t be covering armitage in depth, but it is definitely worth mentioning as something to explore. Our goal is to teach the ins and outs of Metasploit, and the GUI is awesome once you understand how the Framework actually operates.
